# Vehicle-Velocity-Prediction
A machine learning project that uses Random Forest Regressor and Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier algorithm to predict vehicle velocity at any instant given factors such as current velocity, space gap between leader vehicle and current time instant. This project uses the Abu Dhabi dataset as wel as the NGSIM dataset to predict values.
